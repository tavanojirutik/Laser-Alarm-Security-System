# Laser-Alarm-Security-System
Laser based Security System is a type of Security and Alarm System that uses Laser light and a Light Sensor. A Security system protects our homes, offices, banks, lockers etc., from intrusion and unauthorized access.

We all know that movies present exaggerated images of reality, and that's especially true of the way laser security systems are presented by Hollywood. The typical image will show a pattern of crisscrossing red or green shafts of light tilling or outlining a room. The hero (or villain) then carefully steps through the maze, avoiding those lines of light and making it to the diamond. In reality, laser beams are not visible as they travel through the air, unless there is dust or moisture in the air. On the other hand, there will be some scattered light from the mirrors and the detector that can be a giveaway that a laser security System is installed.

The project basically works on the principle of interruption. If by any means the LASER light is interrupted the alarm will start ringing. The laser is a concentrated light source that puts out a straight beam of light of a single colour. The LDR is sensitive to light and puts out a voltage when the laser light hits it. When the laser beam is interrupted and canâ€™t reach LDR, its voltage output changes, and eventually the alarm will ring.
